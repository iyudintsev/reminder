# Reminder

This service allows memorizing and reminding about events you plan.

It works as a telegram bot and requires a token for the communication with the telegram servers.

The token is in file `config.py` as a variable  `token`. The example of this is provided by the file `config.py.dict`.

You should use `python3 main.py` for the execution of the application. 

## The format of messages

`hh:mm text` or `hh-mm text`.

For example, 13:45 to feed the cat.
